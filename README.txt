#### A site for a bookstore, November 18, 2016_

#### By Katy Henning

## Description

This is a basic webpage for a local bookstore. I'm using basic Drupal knowledge to build custom content and using modules to edit this site to make it usable for a bookstore.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository to your desktop https://github.com/KatyCodes/drupalbookstore.git
* If you haven't already installed MAMP please download it here: https://www.mamp.info/en/?_ga=1.24951482.1230295340.1479490647
* Once downloaded go to the "Preferences tab" then click on "Web Server", make sure that the document root is set to the file that you downloaded from git hub.
* Go back to the MAMP home screen and select "Open WebStart page"
* Select "tools" then select "phpMyAdmin"
* Once in phpMyAdmin find the tab labeled "Import"
* Leave all the default settings and make sure the character set is "utf-8".
* Now click on the "Choose File" button next to "Browse your computer" and select the .sql.zip file  included in our drupalbookstore folder. It's okay to leave it zipped.
Then click the "Go" button on the bottom left.
* Go back to the Mamp site and click "My Website"
